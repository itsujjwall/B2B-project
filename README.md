# Description
Account Receivables:
The B2B world operates differently from the B2C or C2C world. Business work with other business on credit.When a buyer business orders goods from the seller business, the seller business issues an invoice for the same. This invoice for the goods contains various information like the details of the goods purchased and when it should be paid.

Seller business interacts with various businesses and sells goods to all of them at various times.
Hence, the seller business needs to keep track of the total amount it owes from all the buyers.
This involves keeping track of all invoices from all the buyers. Each invoice will have various
important fields like a payment due date, invoice date, invoice amount, baseline date etc.
The buyer business needs to clear its amount due before the due date. However, in real-world
scenarios , the invoices are not always cleared ie. paid in full amount in one go. Instead, they
get paid in installments. These installments are known as partial payments.
